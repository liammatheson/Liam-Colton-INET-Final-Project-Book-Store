## Description

- A simple Spring Boot web application for managing a small online bookstore. Users can browse products, view details, and add items to a cart. The project includes controllers, services, repositories, and a basic frontend using Thymeleaf. Authentication is handled with Spring Security, and the application follows an MVC structure. The goal is to demonstrate full-stack development with Spring Boot, JPA, and a functional product catalog.
